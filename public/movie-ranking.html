<h2>Log Horizon 9.0/10</h2>
<p>
 Episodes: 25<br />
Genre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy<br />
Aired: Oct 5, 2013 to Mar 22, 2014
</p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>In the blink of an eye, thirty thousand bewildered Japanese gamers are whisked from their everyday lives into the world of the popular MMORPG, Elder Tale, after the game's latest updateâ€”unable to log out. Among them is the socially awkward college student Shiroe, whose confusion and shock lasts only a moment as, a veteran of the game, he immediately sets out to explore the limits of his new reality.</p>
<h3>Personal Comment</h3>
<p>If you liked Sword Art Online, you'll definitely enjoy this anime as well. The premise is similar, except for the fact that if you die in the game, you will still be able to revive (with a penalty of course), much similar to a video game.</p>
